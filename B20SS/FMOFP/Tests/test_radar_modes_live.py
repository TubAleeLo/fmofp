"""Test suite — targeting, TFR, AEWC and SAR radars against a live system (C14.3).

Replaces four log-scraping suites (radar_tests/{targeting,tfr,aewc,sar}_radar_test.py,
1,416 lines of live code) with one parameterised suite of state assertions.

WHY ONE SUITE AND NOT FOUR
--------------------------
The four originals were structural clones: identical method structure, identical
helpers, only the radar name and enum differed. They also shared the same weakness.
Two of the four regexes each applied per mode cannot fail:

    (f"Sending mode change completion notification|{mode.name}", "Display mode update")
    (f"Using request ID|request_id",                             "Display processing")

The first is satisfied by the bare mode name, which the test itself logs; the second
by the literal substring `request_id`, which appears in the application's own debug
formatting. At 15-17 modes per radar that is roughly 95 verification points reporting
success unconditionally.

THE CONTRACT THESE FOUR ACTUALLY HAVE
-------------------------------------
It is the opposite of the weather radar's, and neither suite said so.

`RadarManagementSystem._get_expected_mode()` implements a mission-phase policy for the
weather radar only (TAKEOFF/APPROACH -> SURVEILLANCE, else MAPPING) and returns
`radar.mode` -- the radar's own current mode -- for these four. So the supervisor is a
deliberate no-op here: a mode set on one of these radars PERSISTS, where the same
action on the weather radar is reverted within a tick.

That asymmetry is the thing most likely to surprise someone, so it is asserted
directly rather than left to be rediscovered. If a mission-phase policy is added for
any of these radars later, these assertions fail and say exactly what changed.

KNOWN DEFECT, DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED HERE
--------------------------------------------
Three of the five radars (weather, TFR, SAR) silently reinterpret an enum member from
a DIFFERENT enum class by its numeric value:

    elif hasattr(mode, '_value_'):
        mode = tfr_radarMode(mode._value_)

Every enum member has `_value_`, so `RadarMode.SEARCH` (value 3) becomes
`tfr_radarMode(3)` -- which is TEST. A command meaning "search" puts the radar into
built-in-test mode. Targeting and AEWC reject the same input and leave the mode alone.

This suite asserts only what is true of all five and should stay true after the fix:
set_mode never raises out, and `radar.mode` is always an instance of that radar's own
enum. The coercion itself is written up as a finding with its own story rather than
frozen into an assertion that the fix would have to break.
