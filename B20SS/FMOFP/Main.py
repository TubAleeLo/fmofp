# ── Path/working-directory bootstrap (same as SystemStart.py) ────────────────
# `python FMOFP/Main.py` is the launch command documented by install.py and
# the README, but running this file directly puts only FMOFP/ on sys.path,
# so the `import FMOFP...` lines below raised ModuleNotFoundError — the
# documented entry point simply did not work (found August 2026 live-boot
# re-verification; SystemStart.py already had this bootstrap, Main.py never
# did). Put the distribution root on sys.path so `import FMOFP...` resolves.
#
# Story C12: B20SS/FMOFP used to be added as a SECOND entry, which let the same
# file be imported under two dotted names and produce duplicate module and class
# objects. Every import is FMOFP-prefixed now, so one entry is enough and the
# dual-path shim that compensated for it is gone.
_HERE = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))          # …/B20SS/FMOFP
_ROOT = os.path.dirname(_HERE)                               # …/B20SS
if _ROOT not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, _ROOT)
# Story C11b: the os.chdir(_ROOT) that used to sit here is gone. It existed
# because config and database paths were written CWD-relative ('FMOFP/dbConfig.xml',
# os.path.join('FMOFP','storage','databases',...)), so the process had to relocate
# itself before anything could be read. Those are now resolved against the package
# (Utils/common/fetching.resolve_resource / resolve_data_dir), so the working
# directory no longer changes program behaviour.
#
# chdir() is process-global: it changed the CWD for anything embedding this code,
# and once the project became pip-installable it pointed the process at
# site-packages, where an installed run proceeded to create 11 SQLite databases
# and a log file. Relocating that data out of the package entirely is story C13.
