        NOTE: This is invoked synchronously from _handle_state_change(), which
        is itself fired synchronously by state_manager.set_state(SHUTDOWN).
        That call happens from *inside* system_manager.stop_system(), which is
        running as part of the still-executing Flight_Management_Operating_Flight_Program.shutdown()
        asyncio task. That means this method's call stack is still nested inside
        an active task on the running event loop.

        Previously this method called self.cleanup() synchronously here, and
        cleanup() calls self._loop.run_until_complete(...) and self._loop.close()
        on that SAME loop. Calling run_until_complete() reentrantly while
        another task on the loop hasn't finished executing is illegal in
        asyncio and raised:
            RuntimeError: Cannot enter into task <...MessageRoutingService.stop()...>
            while another task <...Flight_Management_Operating_Flight_Program.shutdown()...>
            is being executed.
        followed by "Error during cleanup: Event loop stopped before Future
        completed." The loop was then left in an inconsistent state where
        run_forever() never actually returned, so the process kept running
        (Qt timers/animations kept firing) long after "All system components
        stopped" was logged.

        The fix: only schedule loop.stop() here (via call_soon_threadsafe,
        which is safe to call from any context). Do NOT call cleanup() here.
        Once the current task chain finishes unwinding and control returns to
        run_forever(), the scheduled stop() will actually take effect and
        run_forever() will return. SystemStart.py's own `finally:
        initializer.cleanup()` block then runs cleanup() safely, outside of
        any actively-executing task, where run_until_complete()/close() are
        legal.

        Watchdog: even with the fix above, live testing showed that
        confirmed-successful calls to loop.stop() (self._loop.is_running()
        correctly reports False immediately afterward, and Qt's
        QApplication.exit() is confirmed invoked by qasync's QEventLoop.stop())
        do not always cause the underlying QApplication.exec() call inside
        qasync's run_forever() to actually return - some UI widgets run their
        own free-running QTimers (e.g. weather radar animation, ~60fps) that
        keep Qt's native event loop pumping. By this point in shutdown, every
        thread and resource this codebase owns has already been stopped
        cleanly (verified via live SIGTERM testing: thread_manager reports
        zero "did not stop within timeout" errors and all system components
        report stopped within ~4 seconds of receiving the signal) - the only
        remaining thing keeping the process alive is Qt's own event pump. A
        bounded watchdog is the standard, safe way to guarantee the process
        actually exits: if we haven't returned from run_forever() a few
        seconds after every real component has already finished stopping,
        force-exit. This mirrors how orchestrators (systemd/k8s/docker) treat
        graceful shutdown themselves: try to exit cleanly, then hard-kill
        after a bounded grace period.
