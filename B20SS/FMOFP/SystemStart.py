# ── Path bootstrap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Put the distribution root on sys.path so `import FMOFP...` resolves however
# this file is launched (debugger, CLI, venv).
#
# Story C12: B20SS/FMOFP used to be added as a second entry so bare imports
# (Utils.*, storage.*, core.*) would also resolve. That is exactly what allowed
# one source file to load under two dotted names as two separate module and
# class objects. All imports are FMOFP-prefixed now; the shim is deleted.
_HERE = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))          # …/B20SS/FMOFP
_ROOT = os.path.dirname(_HERE)                               # …/B20SS
if _ROOT not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, _ROOT)

# ── Working-directory bootstrap ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# All relative config paths in this codebase (e.g. 'FMOFP/dbConfig.xml',
# 'FMOFP/local_messaging/...') are written relative to B20SS/.
# Normalise CWD to B20SS/ regardless of where the user launched from,
# so those paths resolve correctly whether SystemStart.py is run as:
#   cd B20SS      && py FMOFP/SystemStart.py   (CWD already correct)
#   cd B20SS/FMOFP && py SystemStart.py        (CWD was wrong — fixed here)
# Story C11b: the os.chdir(_ROOT) that used to sit here is gone. It existed
# because config and database paths were written CWD-relative ('FMOFP/dbConfig.xml',
# os.path.join('FMOFP','storage','databases',...)), so the process had to relocate
# itself before anything could be read. Those are now resolved against the package
# (Utils/common/fetching.resolve_resource / resolve_data_dir), so the working
# directory no longer changes program behaviour.
#
# chdir() is process-global: it changed the CWD for anything embedding this code,
# and once the project became pip-installable it pointed the process at
# site-packages, where an installed run proceeded to create 11 SQLite databases
# and a log file. Relocating that data out of the package entirely is story C13.
